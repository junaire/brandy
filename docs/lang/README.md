Language Reference
==================

This section describes the Bril language exhaustively.
The [Syntax](syntax.md) chapter is about the structure of the language---the abstract syntax.
Then, there are several chapters about the actual operations that fit into this general structure.
The [core language](core.md) has the basics, including integers, Booleans, and control flow.
Other extensions add optional functionality on top of this simple core language.
You are cordially invented to add your own similar extensions to the Bril language!
